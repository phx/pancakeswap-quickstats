# pancakeswap-quickstats

This is a script that I wrote over the course of a weekend which will return PancakeSwap stats from the command line.

I'm thinking about tweaking a local version of it to use BetterTouchTool in order to display some stats on my Macbook's Touch Bar.

After searching high and low for something like this, I was never satisfied with my results.

If you want results in the browser, [yieldwatch.net](https://yieldwatch.net) is probably the best resource.

There is even a Telegram bot that gives lots of useful information, ~~but the developer is kind of a dick~~.

Not to be confused with the Telegram bot referenced above, this originally started out as refactoring of the code from
[PancakeSwapInfo_bot](https://github.com/Ghonghito/PancakeSwapInfo_bot), but instead of forking it, I just made this its own project
since very little of the source code remained the same after I was finished.

That being said, [PancakeSwapInfo_bot](https://github.com/Ghonghito/PancakeSwapInfo_bot) is still a good resource if you are looking to
gain insight into multiple syrup pools and aren't worried about farm info.  You just may have to do a little translation, because a lot
of the code content is not in English.

Currently, this script only supports the CAKE syrup pool and the DFT/BNB farm info, but feel free to tweak as necessary to grab all of your relevant info.

## Installation and Usage
